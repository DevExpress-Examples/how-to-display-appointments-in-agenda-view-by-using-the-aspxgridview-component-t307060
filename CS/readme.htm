<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to display appointments in Agenda View by using the ASPxGridView component </h1>
<p>In fact, the Agenda view is a list of upcoming events grouped by an appointment's date. This list can be displayed in ASPxGridView (https://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxGridViewtopic). 

This example demonstrates how to implement this behavior.

 

For demonstration purposes, we also show resources to which appointments belong. The resources are located in ASPxCardView (https://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/clsDevExpressWebASPxCardViewtopic). Since multi-day appointments should be displayed as several ASPxGridView rows (such appointments should be displayed in each "Day" group in accordance with the appointment's duration), we use a separate AgendaAppointment class to store the appointment's data.


To get existing appointments from the ASPxScheduler's scheduler storage and generate a corresponding collection of AgendaAppointment instances, the SchedulerStorage.GetAppointments (https://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraSchedulerSchedulerStorageBase_GetAppointmentstopic1830) method is used.

By default, a month interval is used to fetch appointments for the AgendaView.
